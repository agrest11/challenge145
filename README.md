# challenge145

"You are given an array of n integers. you have to process q queries that either require you to swap two elements with index x and y in the array, or report the current value at index x

Task
You are given a number T and T testcases follow, for each testcase, you are given an integer n and an integer q

In the next line, you are given n integers denoting the array.

Then, q lines follow denoting the queries

For each query you are given an integer t denoting the type of query

If q is 1 you are given two integers x and y denoting the indices of the elements to be swapped

If q is 2 you are given an integer x and you have to output the element at index x

For every query of type 2 print the answer line by line"
